# Color of the Day

## Objective
Using local storage and the Color of the Day API, create a web application that allows users to search a color by date and manage a record of their searches.

Color of the Day Web Application
Overview
This web application allows users to search for the color of the day by date using the Color of the Day API. The application also keeps a record of all user searches and displays them. The search history is stored locally in the browser using local storage.

Features
Date Input Form: Users can input a desired date to search for the color of the day.
API Integration: Uses the Color of the Day API to fetch color data based on the date provided by the user.
Color Display: Displays the color swatch and its corresponding hex value returned by the API.
Search History: Maintains a record of all searched dates and their corresponding colors.
Local Storage: Saves the search history in the browser's local storage to persist data across sessions.
Clear History: Provides an option to clear the search history from both the UI and local storage.
How It Works
Form Submission: When the user submits the form with a date, an API request is made to fetch the color of the day.
Display Color: The color data (hex value) is displayed along with the searched date.
Update History: The search history is updated with the new search and displayed on the page.
Local Storage: The search history is stored in local storage to ensure persistence.
Clear History: Users can clear the entire search history with a click of a button.
